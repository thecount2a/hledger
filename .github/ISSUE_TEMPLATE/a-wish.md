You can delete this template text before submitting.

Some things to check before requesting:

- We try to not clutter the bug tracker with too many wishlist items.
  Often it's best to discuss and attract interest on chat or the mail list first;
  use your best judgement. https://hledger.org#help-feedback

- Have you looked for related features in (the right version of) the user manual ? 
  Use `hledger help [--help]` to view the built-in manuals,
  or view the hledger.org -> USER MANUALS and choose the proper version
  at the top of the page.

Things that will move your request along faster:

- A small example or mockup of your intended UI/output
- A rough draft of intended command line help/reference documentation
